# gitea_team_repository (Resource)

Manages a team repository association in Gitea, assigning a repository to a team.

~> **Warning:** Do not use this resource if the team has `includes_all_repositories = true`. When a team includes all repositories, Gitea automatically grants access to all repositories in the organization, making explicit repository associations unnecessary and potentially confusing. Set `includes_all_repositories = false` on the team to manage repository access explicitly using this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitea_team_repository" "test_team_repo_association" {
  org             = "testorg"
  team_name       = "test-team"
  repository_name = "test-repo-for-org"
}
```
