# gitea_team_repository (Resource)

Manages a team repository association in Gitea. This resource assigns a repository to a team, granting team members access to the repository based on the team's permission level.

## Import

Team repository associations can be imported using the format `org/team_name/repository_name`:

```shell
terraform import gitea_team_repository.example myorg/developers/myrepo
```

~> **Warning:** Do not use this resource if the team has `includes_all_repositories = true`. When a team includes all repositories, Gitea automatically grants access to all repositories in the organization, making explicit repository associations unnecessary and potentially confusing. Set `includes_all_repositories = false` on the team to manage repository access explicitly using this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "gitea_team_repository" "test_team_repo_association" {
  org             = "testorg"
  team_name       = "test-team"
  repository_name = "test-repo-for-org"
}
```
